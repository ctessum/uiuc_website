abstract = {Abstract Modeling atmospheric chemistry is computationally expensive and limits the widespread use of chemical transport models. This computational cost arises from solving high-dimensional systems of stiff differential equations. Previous work has demonstrated the promise of machine learning (ML) to accelerate air quality model simulations but has suffered from numerical instability during long-term simulations. This may be because previous ML-based efforts have relied on explicit Euler time integration—which is known to be unstable for stiff systems—and have used neural networks which are prone to overfitting. We hypothesize that parsimonious models combined with modern numerical integration techniques can overcome this limitation. Using a small-scale mechanism to explore the potential of these methods, we have created a machine-learned surrogate by (a) reducing dimensionality using singular value decomposition to create an interpretably-compressed low-dimensional latent space and (b) using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to create a differential-equation-based representation of the underlying dynamics in the compressed latent space with reduced stiffness. The root mean square error of ML model prediction for ozone concentration over 9 days is 37.8\% of the root mean square concentration across all simulations in our testing data set. The surrogate model is 10× faster with 12× fewer integration timesteps compared to reference model and is numerically stable in all tested simulations. Overall, we find that SINDy can be used to create fast, stable, and accurate surrogates of a simple photochemical mechanism. In future work, we will explore the application of this method to more detailed mechanisms and their use in large-scale simulations.},

	abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure is the largest environmental health risk factor in the United States. Here, we link PM2.5 exposure to the human activities responsible for PM2.5 pollution. We use these results to explore “pollution inequity”: the difference between the environmental health damage caused by a racial–ethnic group and the damage that group experiences. We show that, in the United States, PM2.5 exposure is disproportionately caused by consumption of goods and services mainly by the non-Hispanic white majority, but disproportionately inhaled by black and Hispanic minorities. On average, non-Hispanic whites experience a “pollution advantage”: They experience ∼17% less air pollution exposure than is caused by their consumption. Blacks and Hispanics on average bear a “pollution burden” of 56% and 63% excess exposure, respectively, relative to the exposure caused by their consumption. The total disparity is caused as much by how much people consume as by how much pollution they breathe. Differences in the types of goods and services consumed by each group are less important. PM2.5 exposures declined ∼50% during 2002–2015 for all three racial–ethnic groups, but pollution inequity has remained high.},

abstract = {Commonly considered strategies for reducing the environmental impact of light-duty transportation include using alternative fuels and improving vehicle fuel economy. We evaluate the air quality-related human health impacts of 10 such options, including the use of liquid biofuels, diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) in internal combustion engines; the use of electricity from a range of conventional and renewable sources to power electric vehicles (EVs); and the use of hybrid EV technology. Our approach combines spatially, temporally, and chemically detailed life cycle emission inventories; comprehensive, fine-scale state-of-the-science chemical transport modeling; and exposure, concentration–response, and economic health impact modeling for ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We find that powering vehicles with corn ethanol or with coal-based or “grid average” electricity increases monetized environmental health impacts by 80% or more relative to using conventional gasoline. Conversely, EVs powered by low-emitting electricity from natural gas, wind, water, or solar power reduce environmental health impacts by 50% or more. Consideration of potential climate change impacts alongside the human health outcomes described here further reinforces the environmental preferability of EVs powered by low-emitting electricity relative to gasoline vehicles.},
