Ambient air pollution causes ~4% of total deaths in the United States, more than three times the number caused by motor vehicle crashes. Our group assesses air pollution-related effects of human activity, focusing on mechanistic modeling of outdoor air pollution and its health impacts, quantifying inequities in the distribution of those impacts, and proposing and testing solutions. We study the relationships between emissions, human activities that cause them, and the resulting health impacts, and we develop modeling capabilities to enable these types of analyses.
