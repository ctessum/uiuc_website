From highways to industry, construction to residential energy use, Black people and other
people of color in America are disproportionately affected by nearly every major source
of air pollution. This exposure shortens life expectancy, increases incidence of disease, 
and compounds historic injustices and economic disadvantage. As the U.S. energy,
industrial, and transportation systems evolve, communities need access to air quality
information to participate fully in decision-processes and advance equitable solutions.

With support from the NASA Applied Sciences program, our team will use satellite data and satellite-derived data products to correct these issues. In doing so,
we will create a new platform that combines the causal nature of the [InMAP](https://inmap.run) with the
accuracy of NASA satellite observationsâ€”Satellite-enabled InMAP (SenMAP).

We will use the new SenMAP platform to develop, test, and demonstrate sustained use of
a web-based, GIS-enabled EEJ assessment tool. This new decision-support tool will
provide near-surface annual PM2.5 data for the continental U.S., with high resolution in
population centers (up to 1 km x 1 km), attribution to sources, and support for easy
decision analysis. This data integration project advances through partnerships with the
[American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/), the [Respiratory Health Association](https://resphealth.org/) (of Illinois), and the
[City of Milwaukee Health Department](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Health/) and the [City of Madison Mayor's office](https://www.cityofmadison.com/mayor) (both in
Wisconsin). Through the three phases of the project we will: 1) Apply InMAP and
satellite data to the short-term decision needs of our partners, growing our understanding
of their priorities, needs, and data use; 2) Develop the web-based SenMAP platform,
informed by our partners' experiences and feedback; 3) Expand the utility of SenMAP
through webinars, case studies, how-to guides, and a discussion board to support a
sustained user community.
