abstract: Commonly considered strategies for reducing the environmental impact of
  light-duty transportation include using alternative fuels and improving vehicle
  fuel economy. We evaluate the air quality-related human health impacts of 10 such
  options, including the use of liquid biofuels, diesel, and compressed natural gas
  (CNG) in internal combustion engines; the use of electricity from a range of conventional
  and renewable sources to power electric vehicles (EVs); and the use of hybrid EV
  technology. Our approach combines spatially, temporally, and chemically detailed
  life cycle emission inventories; comprehensive, fine-scale state-of-the-science
  chemical transport modeling; and exposure, concentration–response, and economic
  health impact modeling for ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We find
  that powering vehicles with corn ethanol or with coal-based or “grid average” electricity
  increases monetized environmental health impacts by 80% or more relative to using
  conventional gasoline. Conversely, EVs powered by low-emitting electricity from
  natural gas, wind, water, or solar power reduce environmental health impacts by
  50% or more. Consideration of potential climate change impacts alongside the human
  health outcomes described here further reinforces the environmental preferability
  of EVs powered by low-emitting electricity relative to gasoline vehicles.
