abstract: 'Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure is the largest environmental
  health risk factor in the United States. Here, we link PM2.5 exposure to the human
  activities responsible for PM2.5 pollution. We use these results to explore “pollution
  inequity”: the difference between the environmental health damage caused by a racial–ethnic
  group and the damage that group experiences. We show that, in the United States,
  PM2.5 exposure is disproportionately caused by consumption of goods and services
  mainly by the non-Hispanic white majority, but disproportionately inhaled by black
  and Hispanic minorities. On average, non-Hispanic whites experience a “pollution
  advantage”: They experience ∼17% less air pollution exposure than is caused by their
  consumption. Blacks and Hispanics on average bear a “pollution burden” of 56% and
  63% excess exposure, respectively, relative to the exposure caused by their consumption.
  The total disparity is caused as much by how much people consume as by how much
  pollution they breathe. Differences in the types of goods and services consumed
  by each group are less important. PM2.5 exposures declined ∼50% during 2002–2015
  for all three racial–ethnic groups, but pollution inequity has remained high.'
